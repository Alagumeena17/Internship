Week 2: Making Decisions & Repeating Tasks in Python

📚 Theory Concepts:
If-else statements: Teaching your program to make simple decisions
Comparison operators: equals, not equals, greater than, less than
For loops: Repeating tasks multiple times automatically
While loops: Repeating until a condition is met
Functions: Creating reusable blocks of code
Basic error handling: What to do when things go wrong

🛠️ Hands-On Practice:
Create a program that gives different messages based on time of day
Build a number guessing game using if-else statements
Use for loop to print numbers from 1 to 100
Create a function that calculates area of rectangle
Make a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide
Practice with real-life scenarios: grading system, age categories

🎯 Project:
Build a Simple Student Grade Calculator that takes marks and returns grade (A, B, C, etc.) with encouraging messages for each grade
